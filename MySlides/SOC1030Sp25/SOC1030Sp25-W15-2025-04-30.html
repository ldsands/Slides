                        ## Erving Goffman: the Presentation of Self

                        - **Face**: a positive self-conception/image one has when interacting with others
                            - "On Face-Work" (1955)
                            - Not permanent
                            - Once we show our face to someone we try to act in a way consistent with the face we showed
                                - Inconsistency exposes person to embarrassment and/or being discredited
                        - **The Expressive Social Order**: the set of norms and conventions that govern social interactions and regulate the expression of self within a given social context (Goffman)
                            - Mutually sustained by you and partners
                            - In everyday interactions, the <span style="color: red">body</span> and <span style="color: red">face</span> serves as a critical site of <span style="color: red">performance</span>
                            - Is the expressive social order different in social media?
                        - **Impression management**: This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment of our behavior
                            - done through movement, clothes, speech, facial expressions, etc.
                            - We try to put "our best foot forward" so that people think well of us
                            - Our intend performance/impression is not always interpreted as we expected
                            - How individuals wish to present themselves, but in a way that satisfies their needs and goals, and appropriate to the <span style="color: red">audience</span>
                            - Two ways that people convey impression: <span style="color: red">give</span> and <span style="color: red">give off</span>

                    ## The Online Presentation of Self

                    - It's Complicated By Danah Boyd
                    - What are distinct about the everyday presentation of self on social media?
                    - Body vs. your writing, images, audio, and video
                    - The immediate social situation vs. imagined audience
                        - How can they simultaneously be cool to their peers and acceptable to their parents?
                    - Misunderstanding/misinterpretation of meaning of actions by observers
                        - Situations like this highlight how context is constructed and maintained through participation, not simply observation
                            - Example: A quiz on MySpace titled "What kind of drug are you?"
                                - How might parents and friends interpret this differently?

                    ## The Online Self

                    - Example: Posts from exmormon in a mixed-faith marriage with a TBM
                        - r/exmormon allows for people to express themselves, and discuss topics they cannot in other
                    > [...] I want more out of life. I want to travel, I want to do stuff, I want to have some goddamned alcohol and relax. [...] But I can't. I can't "rock" the boat. I have to pretend all is well in zion. I love my wife and my kids. I don't want to bail. [...] Any time I feel like speaking up for myself, say "I want to go for coffee" I back down, I can't stand the hurt looks I get. [...]
                    >
                    > [...] My young family and I just moved overseas. We are getting adjusted to our new life. The LDS network has its advantages in helping new people find a group of like minded individuals [...] In the two weeks she's gone to church our family has been invited both weeks to have dinner at a ward members house. [...] she's welcome to go but I'm not interested in joining her. [...] generally I find these types of social interactions as awkward and exhausting. [...] I don't care to endure their questioning of why I don't believe or their gazes as they try to figure out what sins are keeping me from seeing the truth. [...]
                    - In your groups discuss these questions:
                        - Is the expressive social order different in social media?
                        - Do we have a different face on social media?
                            - Do we have different faces on different social media platforms?
                        - How might these different faces help or hurt individuals?
                        - How do the mixed-faith marriage posts above relate to the terms we covered today?
                            - Face, The Expressive Social Order, Impression Management

                    ## Sociology and Network Science

                    - Sociological Origins of Network Science
                        - Early theory by Georg Simmel and Emile Durkheim
                        - Some work done with operationalization in the 30s and 50s
                        - In the 1970s developed into a science by Mark Granovetter and several others
                        - Today some (relatively) famous Sociologists (Duncan J. Watts and Nicholas A. Christakis) have gone further with computation and network analysis
                    - Freda Lynn - Sociology of Networks SOC:3880
                        - Only requires SOC:1010 or SOC:1030
                        - Also teaches Capstone and Methods course for undergrads
                    - Yongren Shi - Data Science for Social Good
                        - Also teaches this course
                    - Both Dr. Lynn and Dr. Shi actively use network methods in their research
                    - Dr. Shi and I have done some network science with Reddit (r/incels) using network methods

                    ## Social Networks (Network Science)

                    - _Nodes_: the distinct element or actor
                        - The "dots" in network graphs
                    - _Ties or Edges_: the connections between nodes
                        - The lines connecting nodes
                    - _Hubs_: Nodes with a high degree
                        - Users with many ties (friends) also called bridging ties
                        - Nicholas A. Christakis and sickness on campus
                    - **Small-World**: "Easy" to get from any node to every other node in the network
                        - The average degree of separation between 2 random nodes was 4.7
                            - Source: The Anatomy of the Facebook Social Graph
                    - **Clustering**: to what degree the network is sorted into clusters
                        - Facebook high clustering due to recommendation algorithm
                        - How are clustering and social closure related?
                    - **Homophily**: to what extent the ties are between nodes that are similar to each other
                        - Example: "Mormonverse" on Reddit: automatic banned on r/lds if user has ever posted on r/exmormon

                    </a>

                    - Is this network highly clustered?
                    - What differentiates each cluster from each other?
                    - Imagine that each of these clusters are workers in different departments.
                        - Which cluster would you prefer to be in a work setting?
                        - Which cluster would you prefer to be in when there is a viral outbreak.

                    ## Group Discussion

                    - What platforms do you use?
                    - Do you post content on those platforms, only consume content or both?
                    - How do you act differently on each platform?
                    - Do you have any accounts where you are anonymous?
                        - Why?
                        - What does having an anonymous account enable you to do that you cannot do using an account that isn't anonymous?
                    - Discuss the terms learned in lecture and how they relate to how you act differently based on which social media platform you use
                        - **Small-world network** - "easy" to get from any node to every other node in the network
                        - **Average degree of separation** - the average number of ties between any two random nodes
                        - **Clustering** - to what degree the network is sorted into clusters
                        - **Homophily** - to what extent the ties are between nodes that are similar to each other

                    ## Is Social Media Polarizing
                
                    - **Illusory Truth Effect**: "[...] tendency to believe false information to be correct after repeated exposure" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_truth_effect))
                    - **Continued Influence Effect**: "[...] the tendency for misinformation to continue influencing people's thinking and decision-making even after it has been corrected or debunked." ([Jason Hreha](https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/glossary/continued-influence-effect))
                    - **Confirmation Bias**: the tendency to look for, prefer, interpret, and remember information that confirms their current beliefs (Nickerson 1998)
                    - **Cognitive Dissonance**: "the mental disturbance people feel when they realize their cognitions and actions are inconsistent or contradictory" [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)
                    - **Motivated Reasoning**: uses emotionally biased reasoning to produce justifications or make decisions that are most desired rather than those that accurately reflect the evidence, while still reducing cognitive dissonance
                    - **Echo Chamber**: a media environment in which information and beliefs that confirm prior beliefs are amplified

                    ## Is Social Media Polarizing

                    - This is a hard question to "prove" but there is some interesting research related to the topic
                    - Data from Twitter 2006-2017 (Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral 2018)
                        > "**Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information**, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information." (Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral 2018) emphasis mine
                        - Humans spread fake news more than bots
                    - Analyzed Facebook posts by domain and URL (González-Bailón et al. 2023)
                        - From 1 September 2020 to 1 February 2021 (Includes 2020 Election and January 6th)
                        - Untrustworthy domains or URLs means that they are dis/misinformation
                        - Found that there was segregation both in engagement of URLs but also by exposure to either left or right leaning individuals

                        <li>Twitter: some moderation, increasingly tried to target misinformation (was a public company)</li>
                        <li>X: says it doesn't moderate at all but Elon has influenced both the algorithm and shut down accounts he doesn't like (privately owned by Elon)</li>
                        <li>Threads: purposely reduces political content in their algorithm (owned by Meta)</li>
                        <li>Mastadon: open source all moderated by communities (open source hosted on private servers)</li>
                        <li>Bluesky: tries to moderate mostly via both community management and allowing for more personal moderation tools (also public benefit company)</li>
