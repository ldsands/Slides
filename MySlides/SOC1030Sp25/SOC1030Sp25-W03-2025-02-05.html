                    - [Kennedy v. Bremerton School District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_v._Bremerton_School_District)
                        - Read the top section and background of the Wikipedia page
                    - Discuss in your group "both sides" thinking about how different perspectives might see the prayer (more than two perspectives)
                    - Briefly discuss how this example can illustrate both the personal vs public views as this issue as a social problem
                    - Briefly discuss how this example can illustrate both the general in the particular and strange in the particular
                    - Write a few sentences about what your group discussed and your insights

                    ## Sociological Lens Activity

                    - Separation of Church and State is not ... in constitution but has been built up over a long time
                    - Does the fact that the coach is a Government Employee matter?
                    - Quick note on "voluntarily joining in" to the prayers, he had been inviting people to join him prior to the instances that led to his firing, slowly grew to most of the team (and sometimes most of the rival team)
                    - Think about your potential children someday would you want the coach/teacher to be involved in such overtly religious practices during their "on clock" time as a representative of a government organization?
                        - What if the religion of that coach/teacher was Islam, LDS, Buddhism, Scientology?
                        - Should government be overtly secular?
                        - Under God? (Added in the 1950s)

                    - Sociologists answer lots of questions but sometimes they find correlations that they didn't expect
                    - We will be identifying aspects of these theories in everyday life
                    - First we'll review the 3 classical sociological theoretical frameworks

                        - The **proletariat**, or working class, does not own the means of production and instead is oppressed and exploited by the bourgeoisie

                    ## Structural Functionalism - Functional Structures Persist

                    - Society has needs structures form to fill those needs
                    - The example often used is a living organism
                    - Émile Durkheim - suicide rates in France
                    - Manifest vs. Latent Functions
                    - Limitations and criticisms
                        - Function is a value judgment e.g. sports
                        - Integration in systems mean less freedom e.g. military, religious organizations, education
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Functionalism Example - Health Care in the US

                    - Keep in mind Manifest vs. Latent Functions
                    - Doctors do a majority of the diagnosis work
                    - Due to a lack of doctors nurse practitioners and PAs have increased in number to make up for the lack of doctors
                    - Just because this is how it happened doesn't mean it is the only way to fill a need
                    - Insurance in the US is privatized and largely managed through employers
                        - WWII history - companies competed via healthcare rather than pay
                    - This is not the only way of getting insurance that works look at other countries such as Canada
                </section>

                    ## Conflict Theory

                    - Started with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels
                        - Observed bad conditions in factories in the 1840 England and concluded revolt of the workers
                        - Didn't foresee the gains made by unions and government on behalf of workers
                    - **Bourgeoisie** vs **Proletariat** (resources, power and status)
                        - Purdue Pharma and the Sacklers in the Supreme Court (Harrington v. Purdue Pharma L.P., ET AL.) Raided Purdue, bargaining for immunity
                        - Immunity was denied it has gone back to negotiations
                    - W.E.B. Du Bois - Double Consciousness
                        - has second script that takes the external opinions of another into consideration
                    - In-group vs out-group (us vs them)
                        - e.g. Iowa vs Iowa State, Gonzaga vs St. Mary's, BYU
                    - Limitations and criticisms
                        - Frequently ignore commonalities and consensus
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Conflict Theory - Example

                    - Utah State, Utah and BYU in the formation of the WAC
                    - Utah State in the early 60s was beating Utah and BYU in football
                    - This lined up with the formation of the WAC because Utah and BYU had more money they lobbied to leave Utah State out of the new conference
                    - They did this so Utah State would cease its climb in popularity, it worked really well
                    - Recent conference mergers
                        - WSU and OSU losers, who else?
                    - How does resources, power and status factor into these examples?

                    ## Symbolic Interaction

                    - Grew out of backlash against early Psychology (stimulus response)
                    - Mead/Blumer added interpretation to stimulus response
                    - Cooley the "Looking-glass self" (mirror) we see ourselves how others see us (based upon other's actions toward us)
                    - Use symbols to interact
                        - Uniforms (suit and tie, military ranks, my shirt, etc.)
                    - "If [people] define situations as real, they are real in their consequences."
                    - Limitations and criticisms
                        - does little to address inequality, overly focused on symbols

                    ## Small Group Activity

                    - In your groups, do the following:
                    - Read the first TWO paragraphs of the [Wikipedia page of the Satanic Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Temple)
                    - Now skim the [AP article titled "Man accused of destroying Satanic Temple display at Iowa Capitol is now charged with hate crime"](https://apnews.com/article/satanic-temple-hate-crime-iowa-cb182f8b3235d25fd4949e0b2e4f43f7)
                    - Identify how each of the different theoretical perspectives would analyze/think about this event differently
                        - Conflict Theory
                        - Structural Functionalism
                        - Symbolic Interactionism
                    - Note this year the Satanic Temple was denied from doing anything at the capital
