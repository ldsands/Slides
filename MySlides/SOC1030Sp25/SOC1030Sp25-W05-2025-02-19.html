                    ## Two Types of Inequality

                    - Gradational inequality 
                    - Relational inequality
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Gradational inequality 

                    - Jean-Jacques Rousseau 
                    - Two forms of social inequality:
                        - **Physical (or natural)**, which “consists in a difference of age, health, bodily strength, and the qualities of the mind or the soul.”
                        - **Social**, which “depends on a kind of conventional inequality and is established or at least authorized by the consent of men, …, consists of the different privileges which some men enjoy to the prejudice of others, such as that of being more rich, more honored, more powerful, or even in a position to exact obedience.” (Discourse on Inequality)
                    - **Gradational inequality** = a ladder or scale of inequality: upper, upper middle, middle, lower middle, lower
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Relational inequality

                    - Georg Friedrich Hegel and Karl Marx
                    - Master-slave dialectic / opposing social classes
                    - **Relational inequality** = a structure of social relations that bind together the advantaged and disadvantaged:
                        - A position is relational in a sense that to describe that particular positions are also to describe how it is connected to other positions. 
                        - Capitalists and workers; lords and serfs.
                </section>

                    ## Views of inequality

                    - Gradational inequality = a ladder or scale of inequality: upper, upper middle, middle, lower middle, lower
                    - Relational inequality = a structure of social relations that bind together the advantaged and disadvantaged
                    - (less important) Inequality is a necessary condition of abundance (Thomas Malthus)

                        - Power - The chance of an individual or group to realize their will in social action, even when faced with opposition from others
                        - Prestige - The respect or standing that an individual obtains through appointment or accomplishment

                    - Prof. Christy Glass, Yale Wine
                    - eBird and birding competitions
                    - ["The authors show that as law schools compete to improve their rankings, their programs become more homogenized and less accessible to non-traditional students."](https://www.russellsage.org/engines-anxiety) (Espeland and Sauder 2016)
                    - Survey Experiment: respondents rated two candidates: varied the University, High School, Work Experience, Description on Social Media (Galos 2024)
                        - "I show that subjects favour the upper-class-signalling candidate over the lower-class-signalling candidate and that perceived competence and perceived warmth are two channels through which class-based discrimination may occur." (Galos 2024)

                    - **Social mobility** is the movement between different positions within a system of social stratification in any given society. 
                        - **Horizontal mobility**: a group or individual transitioning from one social status to another situated more or less on the same rung of the ladder. 
                        - **Vertical mobility**: the rise or fall of an individual or group from one social stratum to another.

                        - **Intragenerational mobility**: an individual moves up or down in social class within their own lifetime.
                        - **Economic mobility** is the ability to move up and down the economic ladder during one's lifetime and across generations. [(Pew Trusts)](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/data-visualizations/2013/faces-of-economic-mobility)
                        - **Absolute mobility** looks at whether individuals exceed their parents' family income or wealth as adults. [(Pew Trusts)](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/data-visualizations/2013/faces-of-economic-mobility)
                        - **Relative mobility** assesses individuals' rank on the economic ladder compared with their parents. [(Pew Trusts)](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/data-visualizations/2013/faces-of-economic-mobility)
                    - **Social Reproduction of Inequality**: The basic idea is that social positions (e.g., social class, occupations, education, etc.) tend to pass on from one generation to another
                        - **Social Institution**: institutions are social structures that have rules, norms and boundaries that influence the behavior of individuals.

                    ## Social Stratification

                    - **Social stratification**: **hierarchical** arrangement of people within a society. 
                    - Stratification is a characteristic of society, and not a matter of individual difference.
                    - Simplistic ways of measuring stratifications  using Income and Wealth
                        - **Wealth** is the value of assets minus the value of debts.
                        - **Income** refers to money earned or received.

                    ## What Happened?

                    - Over the last few decades, the rich were getting richer, but the rates are not equal
                        - The greatest contributors to the increasing inequality is the income earned by the very richest
                        - Much of the increase in inequality comes down not to income (like a salary) but wealth which is taxed differently to income
                    - "The Reagan Revolution": Reagan passed some tax reduction bills (trickle down economics), to promote an economic policy that has a long-lasting impact
                    - These economic policies have largely continued over the subsequent decades

                    ## Social Mobility

                    - Social mobility is the movement between different positions within a system of social stratification in any given society. 
                        - **Horizontal mobility**: a group or individual transitioning from one social status to another situated more or less on the same rung of the ladder. 
                        - **Vertical mobility**: the rise or fall of an individual or group from one social stratum to another. 
                        - **Intergenerational mobility**: one generation moves up or down in social class compared with their previous generation.
                        - **Intragenerational mobility**: an individual moves up or down in social class within their own lifetime.
                        - **Economic mobility** is the ability to move up and down the economic ladder during one's lifetime and across generations. [(Pew Trusts)](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/data-visualizations/2013/faces-of-economic-mobility)
                        - **Absolute mobility** looks at whether individuals exceed their parents' family income or wealth as adults. [(Pew Trusts)](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/data-visualizations/2013/faces-of-economic-mobility)
                        - **Relative mobility** assesses individuals' rank on the economic ladder compared with their parents. [(Pew Trusts)](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/data-visualizations/2013/faces-of-economic-mobility)

                    ## The American Dream and Meritocracy

                    - **Meritocracy**: "a system in which one's status is based on merit or accomplishments, not other social characteristics" (Andersen, Taylor, and Logio 2017)
                    - It is assumed that the US is a meritocratic system in which as long as you work hard you will be economically successful or comfortable

                    <ul>
                        <li>Estimates of a child's chances of reaching the top 20% of income distribution given parents in the bottom 20%.  (Chetty et al. 2014)</li>
                        <li>The tax records of 40 million people.</li>
                        <li>The probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is about 13% in San Jose, California, but only about 4% in Charlotte, North Carolina.</li>
                    </ul>

                    ## Why Has Mobility Declined in Recent Decades

                    - Explanations:
                        - Structural Causes (Neoliberalism, globalization, automation, and decline of union)
                        - Social Reproduction of Inequality (**Social Closure**) The basic idea is that social positions (e.g., social class, occupations, education, etc.) tend to pass on from one generation to another. 
                        - (These explanations are not mutually exclusive.)

                    ## Structural Causes for Decline in Social Mobility

                    - **Neoliberalism** is a political and economic perspective that promotes an economic marketplace free of government regulations.
                        - a free-market economic system; advocating tax reduction; small government; anti-labor unions
                        - Neoliberals seek to weaken the influence of the government and workers and thus strengthen the power of corporations.
                    - Reagan administration. "Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.”
                    - Redistribution policies
                    - Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
                    - You might hear many political debates about tax cuts, but if we compare the rate of income taxes paid by employees plus the rate of payroll taxes paid by employers, the US tax rate 30% for an average-paid worker is quite low compared with those other wealthy countries, like Denmark and Norway 36%, Sweden 43% Belgium 53%

                    ## Structural Causes for Decline in Social Mobility

                    - **Automation** and Technology deepen the gap between the well-educated and less-educated.
                    - **Globalization**: the process of creating a world economy with few restrictions on trade.
                    - Decline of Unions: Labor unions are organizations that bring employees together collectively to fight for better wages, benefits, and worker protections.
                        - Well talk about this more in the next class
