                    ## Confronting Social Problems 1

                    - I will look for at least 1 scholarly article cited
                    - ~1000 words
                    - Policy will almost always better
                        - Just save money, not a great option, give me more
                    - Most of the grading is on the second half of the prompt the first half isn't as difficult so it is not worth as as many points

                    ## Poverty in America: Budget Activity

                    - Group members will need to go to different sites then share information with each other
                    - Think about the maximum amount a family of 4 (2 parents, 2 kids) could save every month
                    - Choose a county to focus on

                    ## Monthly Costs

                    - Housing
                        - Subsidized housing usually takes years to get off of wait-lists
                        - Seems low to me (assuming utilities are included)
                        - Looked on Zillow the lowest I saw was $800 (not including utilities) not many below the $1127
                    - Food
                        - This seems really low to me given the increases we've seen over the last few years
                    - Child Care
                        - Possible to get subsidy but difficult
                        - Seems a bit low to me, I would say 1200-1500 per kid is what you see in the Iowa City area
                    - Transportation
                        - In Iowa City can use buses for free this is pretty rare
                        - This assumes a car payment
                    - Health Care
                        - This seems about right to me
                    - Other Necessities
                        - Came from survey from the bottom 20% of households
                    - Taxes would probably be a lot lower than this
                        - Would probably get ~$3,000 dollars in Tax Returns each year

                    ## Social Reproduction of Inequality

                    - **Social Reproduction of Inequality**: The basic idea is that social positions (e.g., social class, occupations, education, etc.) tend to pass on from one generation to another
                    - **Social Institution**: institutions are social structures that have rules, norms and boundaries that influence the behavior of individuals.
                        - Examples: Families, religion, government, schools, healthcare etc.
                    - **Social Capital**: connections to people who have resources you can access
                        - Examples: law or health expertise (doctors, lawyers), job prospects
                    - **Cultural Capital**: class based knowledge and preferences used to signal your class to others
                        - Examples: Opera (RBG), SNL Colbert etc., cars, etc.
                    - **Social Closure**: group boundaries and identities that prevent others from using group resources
                        - Examples: Country clubs, LDS humanitarian aid, Federalist Society etc.

                        <li>Soon after the article, her daughter was hired as a clerk working for the associate justice Kavanaugh.</li>

                    ## Race VS Ethnicity

                    - **Ethnicity**: "a social category of people who share a common culture" (Andersen, Taylor, and Logio 2017)
                        - "Ethic groups have a consciousness of their common cultural bond"
                    - **Race**: "a group treated as distinct in society based on certain characteristics" (Andersen, Taylor, and Logio 2017)
                        - Race is not a biological classification but a socially constructed classification

                    - Irish

                    ### Irish

                    <!-- Irish: it was believed that the Irish were a distinct category of people who carried innate differences in their blood, difference that made them permanently inferior to their white American neighbors. [..] Here in a hundred years ago, race is not binary as mostly recognizable whites and blacks.  -->

                    - Irish immigrants in late nineteenth century America struggled to assimilate amid fierce and widespread racism.
                    - In 1790, Congress passed the naturalization law, limiting rights of citizenship to "free white persons." 
                    - Between 1880 and World War I, 25 millions Europeans immigrants arrived. The notion of "free white persons" was reconsidered. The inclusiveness of "white persons" splintered into a range of Anglos and "barbarous" others, including Teutons, Slavs, Celtics, Swedes. 
                    > "[They are] distinctly marked—the small and some what upturned nose, the black tint of the skin.... [They] are ignorant, and as a consequence thereof, are idle, thriftless, poor, intemperate, and barbaria.... Of course they will violate our laws, these wild bisons leaping over the fences which easily restrain the civilized domestic cattle, will commit great crimes of violence, even capital offences, which certainly have increased as of late."

                    <p>Reeve (2015) "Young's eye was almond shaped, flat, and the lid partially closed, a shape and narrow opening most comparable to that of a hog. For Simms it was clear and physical evidence of Young's 'disposition to love many.' [...] Her eyes were large and round with a wide vertical opening, similar to the eye of a dove—a bird that mates for life (see figure 1.2). Simms thus concluded, 'In the range of Physiognomy everything partakes of a lower nature when built upon the wide and low form.' The almond-shaped eyes with their 'less vertical measurement' produced an 'exhibition of love' that was 'more bestial in its nature, and has little in common with Monoeroticity, which is pure and angelic in its tone.'"</p>

                    ## Racialization

                    - **Racialization**:The process of assigning people a race, along with the personality, behavioral, and social characteristics associated with that race, based on physical or cultural cues (skin color or speech patterns).
                    - Formal laws and social institutions (from top down)
                    - Media and public opinions (from bottom up)

                    ## Race and Social Construction

                    - What does it mean that race is a socially constructed concept? 
                    - The boundaries between the racial groups change over time.
                    - Traits in physical appearance may not always be the marker of a racial group.
                    - Race is real with real social consequences: The dominant group receives social or economic advantages while the oppressed group are worse off!
                    - Race is a social construction, that is that people in the same society share a common understanding about their relationship on the basis of some assumptions about reality.
