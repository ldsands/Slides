                    ## Fishing Activity
                
                    - If you have NOT had the opportunity to participate in the fishing activity yet you will get your chance now
                    - Rules:
                        - Participants are not allowed to talk during the game.
                        - If there is not enough fish in a round, first claim, first get.
                    - The top student in each round with most fish is the best fisherman. They will win a prize (1 extra credit). Participants will receive 0.5 extra credits
                    - How the game is played:
                        - 5 participants join the game in the front of the classroom.
                        - At the start of the game, there is 20 fish in the pond.
                        - Each day (a round of a game), each person can catch 1 to 5 fish.
                        - At each night, the fish in the pond reproduce, and double the size before the next day.
                        - The game will be played for five rounds or when the fishing pond is depleted of fish, whenever comes first.

                    ## Participation Follow Up
                
                    - Rick Phillips' Facebook Comment
                        - Just to make it clear one of the concepts he is pointing to is that the less gender equality (more equal between genders) there is in a country the more likely women are to pursue high paying jobs.
                        - On average STEM pays more.
                        - Where gender inequality is lower (men and women are more equal) women are more likely to pursue non-stem jobs. Some possible explanations:
                            - One explanation is that women prefer non-STEM jobs
                            - Another explanation is that women are dissuaded from joining professions that are majority men due to "workplace culture"
                            - There aren't organizations/programs that push women to pursue STEM as much in some countries
                            - Differences in gender socialization
                            - There are others as well
                    - Another note average petroleum engineer pay $111,000 vs $51,000 for elementary school teachers, both generally require a bachelor's degree
                    - Question for you to think about: are high paying jobs attracting the best and brightest? Or are they just attracting those that want higher pay or prestige?

                    ## Explaining the Wage Gap

                    - This is difficult due to the number of variables that can be relevant
                    - Individuals will often sort into different occupations based on gender
                    - Within an occupation, men and women often perform different kinds of jobs
                    - Possible differences in:
                        - Education
                        - Choice of career
                        - Skills
                        - Experiences
                        - Job responsibilities
                        - Hours worked
                    - Discrimination
                        - Could be due to prejudice, implicit bias, statistical discrimination etc.
                    - Social norms between genders
                        - Married men being alone with women
                        - Norms of men as breadwinners
                    - Parental differences (these are normalized more for women than men)
                        - Parental leave
                        - Taking time off to care for children
                    - Many others

                    ## Occupational Segregation

                    - **Occupational Segregation**: the distribution of workers based on gender
                    - Why are women likely to select into certain occupations? Especially in lower-paid occupations?
                        - The supply side:  gender socialization and "gendered occupation"
                        - The demand side: Power disparity within occupation.
                    - Historacal Examples
                        - Primary school teachers in the U.S. was a "man's job"
                        - Others: real estate sales, clerical work, pharmacy, public relations, bartending, bank telling, and more recently, the academic disciplines of sociology and biology

                    ## Occupational Segregation

                    - How does this occupational segregation happen?
                    - Why did the historically male-dominated occupations become feminized? 
                    - Job Queues, Gender Queues (1990), Barbara Reskin and Patricia Roos
                        - Women end up in lower-paid jobs because these occupations lose (or have lost) their attractiveness for white men. 
                        - As an occupation becomes commercialized, jobs becomes deskilled and less autonomous, earnings decline, routes of upward mobility close off, work conditions in general deteriorate. 
                            - Book editing, "a gentlemen's profession," was turned into "a virtual female ghetto" (Reskin and Roos, 1990)

                    ## The Glass Ceiling

                    - **The Glass Ceiling**: the institutional barriers within a workplace hierarchy that prevent women from reaching upper-level positions.
                        - Two kinds of jobs for women in the corporation: secretarial jobs and managerial jobs (Men and Women of the Corporation, Rosabeth Moss Kanter 1977.)
                        - A cultural conflation of authority with masculinity 
                            - The job often makes the person; the person doesn't make the job

                    ## The Glass Ceiling

                    - 2. gender stereotypes (a study of law firms by Jennifer L. Pierce)
                        - Two kinds of jobs for women in the law firms paralegals and trial lawyers 
                            - Paralegals: are expected to be deferential, caring, and even motherly toward the trial lawyers  
                            - Trial lawyers: are expected to perform masculine emotional labor; but women trial lawyers are described "bitches," "obnoxious," and "shrill."
                        - Female lawyers face in a double bind  -- masculine emotional labor (aggression, intimidation, and manipulation)
                            - "bitches," "obnoxious," and "shrill."
                            - "too nice" and "too bashful."

                    ## The Glass Escalator

                    - **Glass escalator**: when men, especially heterosexual white men, enter female-dominated professions, they experience advantages in pay, promotions, and support from colleagues and supervisors.
                        - Still a Man's World (Christine Williams 1995)
                            - Male nurses, elementary school teachers, librarians, and social workers
                            - Male workers maintain masculine power and privilege.
                        - An inverse of gender escalator in fashion industry: lower pay and less job opportunities for male models.
                            - Structural reasons: no managerial positions or other promotions for models.

                    ## The Glass Escalator

                    > The authors find that although boys are less likely to participate in performing arts than girls, conditional on participating, they are significantly more likely to be leaders. White boys, in particular, have a strong leadership advantage compared with all other schoolmates, and especially to girls of color. The significant disadvantage girls of color face relative to White boys in attaining leadership within feminized domains in high school parallels established patterns in the occupational sphere.

                    ## The Motherhood Penalty

                    - **The Motherhood Penalty**: the loss in wages associated with becoming a mother (estimated at about 5% per child), and tend to be passed over for promotion opportunities
                    - One possible explanation is that employers are biased against mothers
                    - Field experiment (Correll, Benard, and Paik 2007)
                    - They responded to hundreds of advertised job openings with fake cover letters and resumes
                    - Manipulation on the motherhood status
                    - Woman applicants with a young child are less likely to be called back. They are also recommended with less salaries

                    ## Group Discussion

                    - How would you explain the wage gap between male and female workers?
                    - Assume none of these topics we've discussed today is a social problem
                        - If you had to pick of of these possible social issues which would you want to elevate to the level of a social problem
                        - How would you go about making the issues into a social issue
                        - What obstacles would you face in convincing others to also accept this as a social issue (be specific and broad)
