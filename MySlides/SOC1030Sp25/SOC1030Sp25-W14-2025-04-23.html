                        ## Tragedy of the Commons

                        - The tragedy of the commons is a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, <span style="color: red">acting independently</span> according to their own <span style="color: red">self-interest</span>, behave contrary to the <span style="color: red">common good</span> of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource through their collective action.

                        >

                        ## Private Good Vs. Public Good/Commons

                        - Private Good(s): a good that is <span style="color: red">excludable</span> (access can be denied)
                            - i.e. owners can exercise private property rights, preventing those who have not paid for it from using the good or consuming its benefits
                            - Examples: Smart phones, university parking lot
                        - Public Good(s) (or the commons): a good that is both <span style="color: red">non-excludable</span> in that individuals cannot be excluded from use or could be enjoyed without paying for it. ([from Wikipeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons))
                            - Examples: clean air, quietness in the night, atmosphere, oceans, rivers, ocean fish stocks, or even an office refrigerator

                    ## Tragedy of the Commons

                    - Unregulated grazing on common land in Great Britain and Ireland -- William Forster Lloyd (1833) 
                    - "Tragedy of the commons" - [Garrett Hardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Hardin) (1968)
                    - Governing the Commons - [Elinor Ostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom) (1990)
                        - Who has rights to access and use resources?
                        - How much of the resources can be withdrawn?
                        - Who will monitor whether the resource is being used according to the set of rules?
                        - How to punish those who break the rules?
                        - Who will decide what the rules are?
                        - What to do in case of a disagreement?
                    - Rather than privatization of the common resources, or controlled and monitored by the State, people can often self-organize themselves in order to successfully manage their resources by *creating a whole system of social institutions*.

                    ## Hardin's Theory vs Ostrom's Findings

                    - Hardin's theory:
                        - If each herdsman sharing a piece of common grazing land made the individually rational economic decision of increasing the number of cattle he keeps on the land, the collective effect would deplete or destroy the commons
                    - Elinor Ostrom's findings:
                        - She spent time with traditional communities whose life and economy largely dependent on a natural resource base
                        - Switzerland and Japan (mountain meadows), Spain and Philippines (Irrigation system); Nepal (forest); Indonesia (Fisheries)
                        - Ostrom finds that each of these communities have developed their own set of rules for determining how to use their natural resources
                        - Disproved Hardin's theory by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources

                    - Deepening the disparity between developing and developed countries
                    - Developing countries did not significantly contribute to the crisis
                    - Lack of infrastructure and less technological and financial resources
                    - High rates of poverty and income inequality will be exacerbated with climate change

                        ## Poor Often Suffer More

                        - Rural and urban poor both suffer more in the face of natural disasters
                        - Extreme weather patterns portend drastic consequences for society.
                        - Chicago's 1995 heat wave resulting in the deaths of 739 individuals (Klinenberg 2002. Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago)
                            - Got up to 106 degrees F
                            - Most of the fatalities occurred among elderly, African American, and poor residents and were largely the result of <span style="color: red">social isolation</span>
                                - Most of the heat wave victims were elderly poor (often no working air conditioning or could not afford to turn it on)
                                - Many older citizens also hesitant to open windows and doors at night due to fear of crime
                                - Elderly women, who may have been more socially engaged, were less vulnerable than elderly men
                            - Because so many people died during the 1995 Chicago heat wave, the city government brought in refrigerated trucks to store the bodies (source: Dalton Conley You May Ask Yourself)
                        - As we discussed before housing value decreases after natural disasters have dramatically worse impacts on the poor and middle class than the rich

                    ## Potential Solutions and Their Problems

                    - Science As the Solution

                    ## Science As the Solution

                    - Is Science the solution?
                        - It's complicated
                        - There are some technologies that could help reverse climate change but most are either very expensive or very controversial
                        - Clean energy alternatives are getting better and implemented in more places
                        - Other efficiencies
                    - Incentives seen in the Tragedy of the commons apply here
                        - The atmosphere is a shared resource
                        - Emissions from one country impact climate patterns and ecosystems worldwide
                        - Individual actors (e.g. nations or corporations) often prioritize their own economic interests over the common good
                    - Development rights vs. climate change

                        ## Cognitive Dissonance and Motivated Reasoning and Climate Change

                        - **Cognitive dissonance**:"the mental disturbance people feel when they realize their cognitions and actions are inconsistent or contradictory" [(Wikipeda)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)
                        - **Motivated reasoning**: uses emotionally biased reasoning to produce justifications or make decisions that are most desired rather than those that accurately reflect the evidence, while still reducing cognitive dissonance
                        - Is it because liberals and conservatives differ in comprehension of scientific studies?

                    ## Science As the Solution

                    Jacquet, Jennifer. 2022. The Playbook: How to Deny Science, Sell Lies, and Make a Killing in the Corporate World. Unabridged. New York: Random House Audio.

                    > Are you a corporation out to make your fortune at any cost? Are you worried about “facts” and “experts” getting in the way of your profits? Do you wish you could make scientists, journalists, and anyone who asks questions about your suspect business practices disappear? Now you can.
                    >
                    > Whether you are selling tobacco, dealing in oil, or pushing pharmaceuticals, denying climate change or exploiting workers, The Playbook is here to help you obfuscate your way to what you want.

                    > Including how to:
                    >
                    > Massage the statistics to suit your needs. Or, even better, fund studies to make up some new ones
                    > Attract and cultivate university professors who have an axe to grind and are short of cash
                    > Make your problem somebody else's problem—ideally the government's

                    ## Progress in International Treaties

                    - The Kyoto Protocol: adopted on December 11th, 1997, in force on February 16th, 2005
                        - 1st commitment period 2008 to 2012 - 5% reduction against 1990 level
                        - 2nd commitment period 2013 to 2020 - 18% reduction against 1990 level
                        - Mixed results
                    - The Paris Agreement aims to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature
                        - Goal of increase in this century to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels
                        - The agreement: commitments from all major emitting countries
                        - Countries agreed cut their climate-altering pollution and to strengthen those commitments over time
                        - 197 countries—every nation on earth, with the last signatory being war-torn Syria—have adopted the Paris Agreement, Of those, 179 have solidified their climate proposals with formal approval, including the U.S.
                        - US left in 2020 and rejoined in 2021

                    ## Some other Potential Solutions

                    - More International Agreements and Treaties
                    - Changing the payoffs facing individuals and firms
                        - Forcing firms to pay their share of cost of these externalities that they produce
                        - Governmental incentives to encourage public and private consumptions (e.g. public transportation and private cars)
                        - Carbon pricing (cap-and-trade, carbon tax)
                    - Common Pool Resource management and regulation
                    - Non-profit organizations in place of for-profit corporations

                    ## Free-Rider Problem Vaccine Refusal Discussion

                    - Recent Measles Outbreaks (Florida most recently)
                        - Measles has an R0 of ~15 meaning that "every person infected with measles will go on to sicken 15 additional people. [(ABC News)](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/r0-covid-19-virus-key-metric-opening-plans/story?id=70868997)
                        - Declared eliminated in the US in 2000 [(CDC)](https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/s0424-highest-measles-cases-since-elimination.html)
                        - Measles not only kills, but also causes brain damage and [impairs the immune system's memory](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay6485)
                    - Reich, Jennifer A. 2014. "Neoliberal Mothering and Vaccine Refusal: Imagined Gated Communities and the Privilege of Choice." Gender & Society 28(5):679-704.
                        - Mothers see themselves as experts on their children, they deem the risk of infection as less than those of vaccines (they dismiss claims that vaccines are necessary)
                        - Mothers see their intensive practices (controlling feeding, nutrition etc.) as a "superior means of supporting their children's immunity."
                        >"they attempt to control risk through management of social exposure, as they envision disease risk to lie in "foreign" bodies outside their networks, and, therefore, individually manageable."
                        >
                        >"these mothers focus solely on their own children by evaluating—and often rejecting—assertions that their choices undermine community health, while ignoring how their children benefit from the immunity of others."
