                    ## Social Deviance and Crime

                    - What is the difference between social deviance and crime? Should they be treated differently?

                        - Jaywalked?
                        - Sped while driving (and broken other motor vehicle rules)?

                    ## Deviance and Crime

                    - **Social norms**: "are the specific cultural expectations for how to behave in a given situation" (Andersen, Taylor, and Logio 2017)
                    - **Social deviance**: any transgression of socially established norms
                    - **Crime**: an intentional act that violates the criminal law, and penalized by the state
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Let's be more serious
                    
                    - What's your view on the following acts as instances of crime? 
                        - Killing another person?
                        - Women engage in sex outside of marriage?
                        - African Americans use same water fountains and swimming pools with white citizens?
                        - Homosexuality?
                        - Consuming marijuana?

                    ## Changing Boundaries

                    - Construction of criminal offenders
                        - Criminal offenders are not always or very "different" from ourselves
                        - Society creates an "outsider" view of "criminals"
                    - Construction of criminal offenses
                        - Varying boundary between social deviance and crime
                        - Some behaviors are criminal & obviously "bad" other behaviors may be considered "bad" but not criminal & still other behaviors are criminal but not necessarily "bad"!

                    ## Social cohesion

                    - Functionalist view: Emile Durkheim: Worried about society breaking down since not everyone was on farms anymore thus had different values, experiences, beliefs etc.
                    - **Social cohesion**: the extent to which society holds together without dissolving into conflict.
                        - Can think of this as how much trust there is in a group or having common goals, values etc.
                    - **Collective conscience**: the common faith or set of social norms by which a society and its members abide
                        - Examples: Sports teams - [What are some rituals that relate to sports?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi_HiInBipc)
                    - Religions and political parities are good examples of both
                    - What are some groups that you think would have high social cohesion or have a collective conscience?

                    ## Types of Solidarity

                    - **Mechanical solidarity**: social cohesion is based on sameness (same values, beliefs, behaviors) -- agrarian society
                        - Likely to get along with those like you
                        - Example: you'll get along with those with the same or similar identities as you
                    - **Organic solidarity**: social cohesion is based on difference and interdependence of the parts -- industrialized society
                        - Likely to get along with those who you depend on or who depend on you
                        - Example: you'll get along with your doctor, your kids' teachers etc.
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Solidarity and Justice

                    - Associated with Mechanical solidarity: **Punitive justice**: makes the offender suffer and thus defining the boundaries of acceptable behavior, and unite the collectivity through punishment such as hanging, stoning, public shaming, etc.
                        - Example: UN parking tickets from countries with intensive kinship narrow circle of trust, for them intent doesn't matter - The WEIRDest People in the World (Henrich 2020)
                    - Associated with Organic solidarity: **Rehabilitative justice**: Rehabilitative responses are tailored to individual perpetrator, because of the varying circumstances and conditions.
                        - Example: Think Boeing and all the issues with them, very few have been indicted for what they did with the 737 MAX

                    ## Labeling theory
                    
                    - A symbolic interactionist approach to social deviance
                    - **Labeling theory**: the belief that individuals subconsciously notice how others see or label them, and their reactions to those labels over time form the basis of their self-identity
                    - Labeling theory argues that it is through the social process of labeling that we create deviance by assigning **shared meanings** to acts
                        - **Shared meanings**: the common understandings that are socially constructed that are attached to some action, symbol, concept etc.
                    - "Culture [or social boundaries] is actually 'enforced' through the **social sanctions** applied to those who violate **social norms**" (Andersen, Taylor, and Logio 2017)
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Labeling theory

                    - Example: think about Jane Elliott and her blue eye, brown eye experiment
                    - Example: when diagnosed with a mental illness/disorder, to prevent change to self-concept patients engage in coping behaviors in the study they examine how some factors predict which coping methods the patients will use (Kroska and Harkness 2011)
                        - Concealing treatment history
                        - Educating others about mental illness
                        - Withdrawing from social interaction
                        - Medical Sociology and Criminology both use labeling theory
                    - [Prof. Sarah Harkness](https://sociology.uiowa.edu/people/sarah-harkness) - Medical Sociology, Sociology of Mental Health, Gender and Society
                    - How might labels relate to crime and race? How might these labels impact someone over the long term?

                    ## Policing is Dangerous Work

                    - In 2018, for instance, 144 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty, 52 of whom were killed by gunfire (National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund 2018).
                    - Work-related injuries including assaults, transportation accidents etc.
                    - Police frequently interact with people in moments of crisis
                    - Responding to violent crime is dangerous
                        - This is especially true in the United States, where guns are easily accessible
                    - Increased risk of occupational stress, compassion fatigue, depression, burnout, and even suicide

                    ### Philip Zimbardo's Vandalism Experiment (Zimbardo 1969)
                    > He arranged to have an automobile without license plates parked with its hood up on a street in the Bronx and a comparable automobile on a street in Palo Alto, California. The car in the Bronx was attacked by "vandals" within ten minutes of its "abandonment." The first to arrive were a family—father, mother, and young son—who removed the radiator and battery. Within twenty-four hours, virtually everything of value had been removed. Then random destruction began—windows were smashed, parts torn off, upholstery ripped. Children began to use the car as a playground. Most of the adult "vandals" were well-dressed, apparently clean-cut whites. The car in Palo Alto sat untouched for more than a week. Then Zimbardo smashed part of it with a sledgehammer. Soon, passersby were joining in. Within a few hours, the car had been turned upside down (Kelling and Wilson 1982)

                    ## Broken Windows Policing and Theory of Deviance

                    - **Broken windows theory of deviance**: social context and social cues impact the way individuals act, if there is disorder there will be more deviant behavior
                        - The context impacts how individuals think about what informal norms and behaviors are acceptable (or at least more acceptable)
                    - Phrased differently:
                        - **Broken windows theory of deviance**: social context and social cues impact the way individuals act, if there is disorder there will be more deviant behavior

                    ## Evidence for Broken Windows

                    - Labeling theory predicts that:
                        - The ways other people see you affect your behavior
                    - Similarly ...
                    - Broken windows theory predicts that:
                        - The way you see your social surroundings also affect behavior
                    - Graffiti Experiment
                    - George Kelling hired by NY Transit Authority in 1984 (Sloan-Howitt and Kelling 1990)
                        - devised a plan to crack down on graffiti
                        - graffiti-covered cars -> more graffiti and perhaps even violent crimes
                        - The Transit Authority "launched a massive campaign" to clean up all the graffiti within 2 hours
                    - Later in the 1990s Rudy Giuliani also initiated a crime reduction campaign
                        - Targeted petty crimes like public urination, the drinking of alcohol in public, and graffiti
                    - Since these campaigns the rates of nearly all crimes have fallen
