                        ## Sex & Gender

                        > I got followed into a <span style="color: red">women's bathroom</span> today at school.
                        >
                        > The man who followed me, a teacher, called, "Young man!" in a shocked voice.
                        >
                        > I turned, and immediately realized what had happened. Several people, men and women alike, have confronted me in bathrooms at this point. Most apologize after they hear my voice; I look fairly androgynous, but I sound like a Disney princess.
                        >
                        > I am a <span style="color: red">trans man</span>, but in situations like this, people assume that I am a trans woman, which can be dangerous for me.
                        >
                        > In most cases, I back down quickly when someone confronts me, for my own safety. Today, though, I saw an opening to fight back a little. I'm on my period, and I was heading into the bathroom to change my pad. I had a new, unopened one in my pocket.
                        >
                        > "Sorry," I said to the teacher in my highest pitched voice. I pulled out the pad and held it up. "I was just going to change my pad."
                        >
                        > He muttered something about me looking like a boy and backed up a little.
                        >
                        > I was secretly flattered, because I want to look like a boy, but obviously that isn't a good reason to chase someone into a bathroom. "No worries," I said in my sugarplum fairy voice. "Sometimes it's easy to forget that there are a lot of ways to look like a girl." Then I marched into a stall and shut the door.

                        - Elliot Jackson (Conley 2021)
                        - The teacher makes a key assumption: that because Elliot looks like a boy, he shouldn't be going into girl's bathroom

                    ## Sex

                    - Sex is a biological construct and is defined by our external genitalia, chromosomes, and internal reproductive organs. (Korgen and Atkinson 2021)
                    - There are several components that can muddy what someone might think of as the sex of an individual
                        - Two sex categories, male and female, are according to the sex chromosomes XY and XX. 
                        - Reproductive organs
                        - The behavioral consequences of hormones
                        - Relative physical strength of bodies
                    - Is sex a binary concept? 
                        - **Intersex**: disorder of sex development (those born with both, neither, or ambiguous male and/or female genitalia)
                        - An estimation of 1-2 percent of live births are deviations from binary male or female bodies.
                        - Corrective genital surgeries conducted between 1 and 2 in every 1,000 births. (Parisi et al. 2007)

                        ## Sex As a Social Construction

                        - Society plays a role in the biological category of sex! (Sex is in itself a social construction)
                            - The Intersex Society of North America published this <span style="color: red">satirical</span> postcard to argue that medical standards for "normal" baby genitalia are arbitrary and result in unnecessary surgeries.

                        ## Gender

                        - **Gender**: a social distinction between <span style="color: red">roles and expectations</span> linked to sex.
                            - Society assigns men masculine traits and women feminine traits

                        <img src="../pics/SOC1030Fa2024/SOC1030Fa24-C18-W09-24-10-24-Th/GenderTraits.avif" style="margin:0; object-position: center; object-fit: contain; height: 56vh; width: 100vw">

                        - Many of these gender traits are seen very different by younger generations than by older generations
                        - **Biological essentialism**: "a belief system that suggests certain characteristics, behaviors, or abilities are inherently linked to one's biology or genetics. It implies that traits such as gender, race, or sexual orientation are determined solely by biological factors, disregarding the influence of social, cultural, or environmental factors. This perspective tends to oversimplify the complexity of human identity and diversity, reinforcing stereotypes and prejudices."

                        ### What Are the Gender Norms in Non-Western Societies? (Sociological Imagination)

                        - In the Navajo society of Native Americans, there are three gender categories: masculine men, feminine women, and the *Nádleehi*, which is an "effeminate male" or "male-bodied person with a feminine nature".
                        - *Hijras* in India are phenotypic men who wear female clothing and ideally, renounce sexual desire and practice. They dedicate to the goddess Bedhraj Mata, conferring fertility to newlyweds and newborns

                    ## Participation Activity

                    - Discuss Rick Phillips' hot take on the research by Stoet and Geary (2018)

                    > As societies approach gender equality (Y axis) women are LESS LIKELY to choose majors in STEM fields (X axis). This has been replicated many times.
                    >
                    > This is probably because nations that have gender equality are also prosperous, and this allows women to pursue what interests them (teaching, fashion, music, etc.) rather than chase dollars. Compared to women in Norway, women in Vietnam don't have this luxury. Social scientists have been slow to acknowledge this because we have a knee-jerk (and silly) aversion to anything that smacks of biological essentialism.
                    >
                    > Unfortunately, this blind spot leads to bad policy. Of course, any woman who wants to pursue engineering or computer science should be encouraged and supported. But maybe the solution isn't to try and push more women into STEM fields that they don't find interesting. Perhaps we should be pushing to raise the pay of the careers that women want. I will happily argue with anyone that a great 2nd grade teacher is worth more to society than a petroleum engineer, and we'd be better off if they were paid the same.

                    ## Doing Gender

                    - **Doing Gender** is the idea that gender, rather than being an innate quality of individuals, is a psychologically ingrained social construct that actively surfaces in everyday human interaction. (West and Zimmerman, 1987)
                        - Alternate definition: "[G]ender as something accomplished through the ongoing social interactions people have with one another" (Andersen, Taylor, and Logio 2017 p. 273)
                    - Sex difference is the assumed biological category
                        - Gender difference is "established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one's membership in one or the other category" - West and Zimmerman "Accounting for doing gender"
                        - Each culture has its own way of "doing gender."
                        - Gender is a social construction
                        - Fluidity of our gender ideal over time (pink as a "strong" color)

                    ## Explaining the Wage Gap

                    - This is difficult due to the number of variables that can be relevant
                    - Individuals will often sort into different occupations based on gender
                    - Within an occupation, men and women often perform different kinds of jobs
                    - Possible differences in:
                        - Education
                        - Choice of career
                        - Skills
                        - Experiences
                        - Job responsibilities
                        - Hours worked
                    - Discrimination
                        - Could be due to prejudice, implicit bias, statistical discrimination etc.
                    - Social norms between genders
                        - Married men being alone with women
                        - Norms of men as breadwinners
                    - Parental differences (these are normalized more for women than men)
                        - Parental leave
                        - Taking time off to care for children
                    - Many others

                    ## Occupational Segregation

                    - **Occupational Segregation**: the distribution of workers based on gender
                    - Why are women likely to select into certain occupations? Especially in lower-paid occupations?
                        - The supply side:  gender socialization and "gendered occupation"
                        - The demand side: Power disparity within occupation.
                    - Historacal Examples
                        - Primary school teachers in the U.S. was a "man's job"
                        - Others: real estate sales, clerical work, pharmacy, public relations, bartending, bank telling, and more recently, the academic disciplines of sociology and biology

                    ## Occupational Segregation

                    - How does this occupational segregation happen?
                    - Why did the historically male-dominated occupations become feminized? 
                    - Job Queues, Gender Queues (1990), Barbara Reskin and Patricia Roos
                        - Women end up in lower-paid jobs because these occupations lose (or have lost) their attractiveness for white men. 
                        - As an occupation becomes commercialized, jobs becomes deskilled and less autonomous, earnings decline, routes of upward mobility close off, work conditions in general deteriorate. 
                            - Book editing, "a gentlemen's profession," was turned into "a virtual female ghetto" (Reskin and Roos, 1990)

                    ## The Glass Ceiling

                    - **The Glass Ceiling**: the institutional barriers within a workplace hierarchy that prevent women from reaching upper-level positions.
                        - Two kinds of jobs for women in the corporation: secretarial jobs and managerial jobs (Men and Women of the Corporation, Rosabeth Moss Kanter 1977.)
                        - A cultural conflation of authority with masculinity

                        - Two kinds of jobs for women in the law firms paralegals and trial lawyers 
                            - Paralegals: are expected to be deferential, caring, and even motherly toward the trial lawyers  
                            - Trial lawyers: are expected to perform masculine emotional labor; but women trial lawyers are described "bitches," "obnoxious," and "shrill."
                        - Female lawyers face in a double bind  -- masculine emotional labor (aggression, intimidation, and manipulation)
                            - "bitches," "obnoxious," and "shrill."
                            - "too nice" and "too bashful."

                    ## The Glass Escalator

                    - **Glass escalator**: when men, especially heterosexual white men, enter female-dominated professions, they experience advantages in pay, promotions, and support from colleagues and supervisors.
                        - Still a Man's World (Christine Williams 1995)
                            - Male nurses, elementary school teachers, librarians, and social workers
                            - Male workers maintain masculine power and privilege.
                        - An inverse of gender escalator in fashion industry: lower pay and less job opportunities for male models.
                            - Structural reasons: no managerial positions or other promotions for models.

                    ## The Glass Escalator

                    > The authors find that although boys are less likely to participate in performing arts than girls, conditional on participating, they are significantly more likely to be leaders. White boys, in particular, have a strong leadership advantage compared with all other schoolmates, and especially to girls of color. The significant disadvantage girls of color face relative to White boys in attaining leadership within feminized domains in high school parallels established patterns in the occupational sphere. (Keynton and Lee 2024)

                    ## The Motherhood Penalty

                    - **The Motherhood Penalty**: the loss in wages associated with becoming a mother (estimated at about 5% per child), and tend to be passed over for promotion opportunities
                    - One possible explanation is that employers are biased against mothers
                    - Field experiment (Correll, Benard, and Paik 2007)
                    - They responded to hundreds of advertised job openings with fake cover letters and resumes
                    - Manipulation on the motherhood status
                    - Woman applicants with a young child are less likely to be called back. They are also recommended with less salaries

                    ## Group Discussion

                    - How would you explain the wage gap between male and female workers?
                    - Assume none of these topics we've discussed today is a social problem
                        - If you had to pick of of these possible social issues which would you want to elevate to the level of a social problem
                        - How would you go about making the issues into a social issue
                        - What obstacles would you face in convincing others to also accept this as a social issue (be specific and broad)
