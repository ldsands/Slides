                        ## Application Assignment 01

                        - Part 1 is comparatively easy
                        - For part 2 I'm looking for you to use sources and/or your own creativity to discuss policies their possible benefits, downsides, difficulties with implementation etc.
                            - Now reflect on how these “known unknowns” of financial life might reinforce class stratification. Narrate a realistic scenario of events that might transpire in that worst-case scenario. What policies or programs might we have to avoid vicious circles of poverty or financial rabbit holes—without creating incentives that could backfire (i.e., inadvertently cause people not to save any money themselves)?

                        ## Social Mobility

                        - Social mobility is the movement between different positions within a system of social stratification in any given society. 
                            - **Horizontal mobility**: a group or individual transitioning from one social status to another situated more or less on the same rung of the ladder. 
                            - **Vertical mobility**: the rise or fall of an individual or group from one social stratum to another. 
                            - **Intergenerational mobility**: one generation moves up or down in social class compared with their previous generation.
                            - **Intragenerational mobility**: an individual moves up or down in social class within their own lifetime.
                            - **Economic mobility** is the ability to move up and down the economic ladder during one's lifetime and across generations. [(Pew Trusts)](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/data-visualizations/2013/faces-of-economic-mobility)
                            - **Absolute mobility** looks at whether individuals exceed their parents' family income or wealth as adults. [(Pew Trusts)](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/data-visualizations/2013/faces-of-economic-mobility)
                            - **Relative mobility** assesses individuals' rank on the economic ladder compared with their parents. [(Pew Trusts)](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/data-visualizations/2013/faces-of-economic-mobility)

                        ## The American Dream and Meritocracy

                        - **Meritocracy**: "a system in which one's status is based on merit or accomplishments, not other social characteristics" (Andersen, Taylor, and Logio 2017)
                        - It is assumed that the US is a meritocratic system in which as long as you work hard you will be economically successful or comfortable

                        ## How Do Sociologists Study Mobility?

                        - A mobility table is a two-way contingency table in which the individuals are classified according to origins and destinations.
                        - Job examples:
                            - Upper-nonmanual: lawyers, engineers; doctors
                            - Lower-nonmanual: customer representatives; sales person; bank teller
                            - Upper-manual: electricians, Carpenters, 
                            - Lower-manual: General Laborers, janitors, assembly line workers

                        ## Mobility Table

                        - Social reproduction of occupation between fathers and sons. Numbers in diagonal cells are often larger than those in off-diagonal cells.
                        - Non-manual fathers tend to raise non-manual sons; the patterns hold for fathers-sons in manual and farm occupations.
                        - General upward mobility farm -> manual -> non-manual is an outcome of structural changes in our society.
                        - Do you notice any unexpected numbers?

                            <li>The probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is about 13% in San Jose, California, but only about 4% in Charlotte, North Carolina.</li>

                        ## Why Has Mobility Declined in Recent Decades

                        - Explanations:
                            - Structural Causes (Neoliberalism, globalization, automation, and decline of union)
                            - Social Reproduction of Inequality (**Social Closure**) The basic idea is that social positions (e.g., social class, occupations, education, etc.) tend to pass on from one generation to another. 
                            - (These explanations are not mutually exclusive.)

                        ## Structural Causes for Decline in Social Mobility

                        - **Neoliberalism** is a political and economic perspective that promotes an economic marketplace free of government regulations.
                            - a free-market economic system; advocating tax reduction; small government; anti-labor unions
                            - Neoliberals seek to weaken the influence of the government and workers and thus strengthen the power of corporations.
                        - Reagan administration. "Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.”
                        - Redistribution policies
                        - Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
                        - You might hear many political debates about tax cuts, but if we compare the rate of income taxes paid by employees plus the rate of payroll taxes paid by employers, the US tax rate 30% for an average-paid worker is quite low compared with those other wealthy countries, like Denmark and Norway 36%, Sweden 43% Belgium 53%

                        ## Structural Causes for Decline in Social Mobility

                        - **Automation** and Technology deepen the gap between the well-educated and less-educated.
                        - **Globalization**: the process of creating a world economy with few restrictions on trade.
                        - Decline of Unions: Labor unions are organizations that bring employees together collectively to fight for better wages, benefits, and worker protections.

                        ## What is poverty? 

                        - **Poverty** a condition of deprivation due to economic circumstances that are severe enough that the individual cannot live with dignity in his or her society. 
                        - **Poverty line** (poverty threshold) - estimated food cost per household size, multiplied by 3. Household with income below this line is considered “poor.” 
                        - **Severe poverty**: income less than half of federal poverty line

                        ## Problems With the Poverty Line

                        - Many criticisms of the choice of multiplier - is 3 too much or too little? 
                        - Based on food - should it be housing? Something else? 
                        - Does not take account of wealth or assets

                        - In your opinion, what are the causes of poverty for the working poor, a significant portion of which is racial minority?
                        - Discuss different positions even if you don't agree with it

                        ## The Culture of Poverty Argument

                        - Poor people have different values 
                            - Edward Banfield - The Unheavenly City (Banfield 1990)
                            - Instant-gratification mentality
                            - Lack motivation to work
                            - Personality traits and culture poverty in lower class;
                            - Society is not the one to blame, rather, individuals in lower class are responsible for their own poverty.

                        ## Structural Causes of Poverty

                        - William Julius Wilson argues that poverty is structural, not cultural (Wilson 2012)
                            - Deindustrialization, globalization, suburbanization, discrimination make it difficult to transition to work. 
                            - Many jobs do not pay living wage or provide benefits 
                                - Federal minimum wage increases to $7.25 in 2009 
                                - About $15,000 per year if working 40 hrs per week 
                                - Below poverty line for household of 3 or more 
                            - Lack of jobs results in shortage of eligible men to marry.

                        ## Experiment: Moving To Opportunity 

                        - A housing voucher plan to help 7,100 families in public housing in 1990s https://www.hud.gov/programdescription/mto
                            - Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City
                        - The goal was to disperse at least 75 percent of the families into neighborhoods with less than 30 percent minority residents. 
                            - One-third received no housing voucher at all, 
                            - One third received vouchers with no restrictions on where they moved, 
                            - The final group—the treatment group—received the vouchers and assistance in relocating to rental units in areas with less than 10 percent poverty rates plus tutorials in basic life skills ranging from balancing a checkbook to yard work to lease negotiation.

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Which outcomes of the MTO would you expect?

                        - Significant long-term improvements in economic self-sufficiency
                        - Moving to lower-poverty neighborhoods significantly reduced welfare dependence
                        - Reduction in youth delinquency and violence
                        - Children who moved to lower-poverty neighborhoods at a younger age showed some positive outcomes in educational attainment
                        - The disruption of social networks, leading to feelings of isolation or difficulty integrating into new communities.

                        ## Poverty in America: Budget Activity

                        - Group members will need to go to different sites then share information with each other
                        - Think about the maximum amount a family of 4 (2 parents, 2 kids) could save every month

                        ## Monthly Costs

                        - Housing
                            - Subsidized housing usually takes years to get off of waitlists
                            - Seems low to me (assuming utilities are included)
                            - Looked on Zillow the lowest I saw was $800 (not including utilities) not many below the $1127
                        - Food
                            - This seems really low to me given the increases we've seen over the last few years
                        - Child Care
                            - Possible to get subsidy but difficult
                            - Seems a bit low to me, I would say 1200-1500 per kid is what you see in the Iowa City area
                        - Transportation
                            - In Iowa City can use buses for free this is pretty rare
                            - This assumes a car payment
                        - Health Care
                            - This seems about right to me
                        - Other Necessities
                            - Came from survey from the bottom 20% of households
                        - Taxes would probably be a lot lower than this
                            - Would probably get ~$3,000 dollars in Tax Returns each year
