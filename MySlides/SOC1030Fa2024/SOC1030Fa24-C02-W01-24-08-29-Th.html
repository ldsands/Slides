                        ### Why are some, but not other, social conditions considered social problems?

                        - A multitude of social issues compete for attentions and resources.
                        - Power, simply defined as one's way of doing things in facing obstructions. 
                            - The power of Economical and political elites
                            - The power of the organized people
                        - Competing ways of defining a social problem
                            - Defining a social problem is often aligned with the interest, identity, morality, social status and power of social groups.
                        - Subjective understanding of a social problem is greatly limited by their social contexts
                            - Information bubble and motivated reasoning

                        - Example: Gay Marriage
                            - ["The evidence review revealed that for LGBT individuals and same-sex couples, their children, and the general U.S. population, the benefits of access to legal marriage for same-sex couples are unambiguously positive" (Rand 2024)](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2912-1.html)
                            - [Social science reports that assess the objective outcomes for children raised in homes aside from a heterosexual, intact marriage are clear: All other family forms involve higher levels of instability (the average length of same-sex marriages is half that of heterosexual marriages); financial stress or poverty; or poorer behavioral, psychological, or educational outcomes. (Project 2025)](https://www.project2025.org/policy/)
                            - ["redefining marriage in the law can have profound consequences for society, particularly for children. Mothers and fathers matter, and they are not interchangeable."

                        - Stage 1: Emergence and Claims Making - claim-makers try to influence public perceptions of, the reasons for, and possible solutions to the social problem
                        - Stage 2: Legitimacy - Persuade others (often government) that their claims are legitimate
                        - Stage 3: Renewed Claims Making - actors may conclude that action is too limited, they may make demands again and often criticizing official responses
                        - Stage 4: Development of Alternative Strategies - claim-makers may realize that these claims may fail to win an adequate response from established interests, they develop their own strategies to address the problem

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Social Problems Process: Two Approaches: Best

                        - Stage 1: Claimsmaking - claimsmakers argue a troubling condition should be recognized as social problem and should be addressed
                        - Stage 2: Media coverage - claimsmakers bring social problem to wider audience through media
                        - Stage 3: Public reaction - the public responds in different ways to the claims made
                        - Stage 4: Policymaking - policies/laws are changed to address the troubling conditions
                        - Stage 5: Social problems work - the implementation/enforcement of the policies/laws meant to address the troubling conditions
                        - Stage 6: Policy outcomes - policy/law changes are evaluated and critiqued (doesn't to far enough vs goes too far)

                        ### Participation Activity 01

                        - Think of troubling conditions that you think could become a social problem
                            - This could be an existing problem or a newer potential social problem
                        - Briefly describe the social problems process through each stage of either approach
                            - Who are the key actors, what events can occur to progress to other stages
                            - Is progression onto each stage inevitable
                        - To turn in (on ICON) write about what you think is the most important stage of the social problems process, explain why in a few sentences.
                            - Use examples (you can use the examples you discussed with your group)
