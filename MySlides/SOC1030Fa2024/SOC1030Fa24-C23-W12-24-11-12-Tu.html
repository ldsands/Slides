                        ## Climate Change

                        - **Greenhouse Gases**: gasses that when trapped in the atmosphere catch solar radiation that releases heat more than other gasses in the atmosphere
                            - These gasses when present in large quantities in the atmosphere increases temperatures
                                - When we see large changes in temperature there are large impacts on many different natural systems
                            - Includes carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrous oxide, fluorinated gases, and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)
                        - The growth rate of emissions was close to 1 percent annually in the 1990s and grew to an average 3 percent annually in the last decade
                        - The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that 3.5 percent of global warming results from airplanes, and this figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 (Penner et al., 1999).
                        - Deforestation is the second-largest contributor to rising temperatures

                    ## Unequal capacity for adaptation

                    - Deepening the disparity between developing and developed countries
                    - Developing countries did not significantly contribute to the crisis
                    - Lack of infrastructure and less technological and financial resources
                    - High rates of poverty and income inequality will be exacerbated with climate change

                        ## Poor Often Suffer More

                        - Rural and urban poor both suffer more in the face of natural disasters
                        - Extreme weather patterns portend drastic consequences for society.
                        - Chicago's 1995 heat wave resulting in the deaths of 739 individuals (Klinenberg 2002. Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago)
                            - Got up to 106 degrees F
                            - Most of the fatalities occurred among elderly, African American, and poor residents and were largely the result of <span style="color: red">social isolation</span>
                                - Most of the heat wave victims were elderly poor (often no working air conditioning or could not afford to turn it on)
                                - Many older citizens also hesitant to open windows and doors at night due to fear of crime
                                - Elderly women, who may have been more socially engaged, were less vulnerable than elderly men
                            - Because so many people died during the 1995 Chicago heat wave, the city government brought in refrigerated trucks to store the bodies (source: Dalton Conley You May Ask Yourself)
                        - As we discussed before housing value decreases after natural disasters have dramatically worse impacts on the poor and middle class than the rich

                    ## Science As the Solution

                    - Is Science the solution?
                        - It's complicated
                        - There are some technologies that could help reverse climate change but most are either very expensive or very controversial
                        - Clean energy alternatives are getting better and implemented in more places
                        - Other efficiencies
                    - Incentives seen in the Tragedy of the commons apply here
                        - The atmosphere is a shared resource
                        - Emissions from one country impact climate patterns and ecosystems worldwide
                        - Individual actors (e.g. nations or corporations) often prioritize their own economic interests over the common good
                    - Development rights vs. climate change

                        ## Cognitive Dissonance and Motivated Reasoning and Climate Change

                        - **Cognitive dissonance**:"the mental disturbance people feel when they realize their cognitions and actions are inconsistent or contradictory" [(Wikipeda)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)
                        - **Motivated reasoning**: uses emotionally biased reasoning to produce justifications or make decisions that are most desired rather than those that accurately reflect the evidence, while still reducing cognitive dissonance
                        - Is it because liberals and conservatives differ in comprehension of scientific studies?

                    ## Science As the Solution

                    Jacquet, Jennifer. 2022. The Playbook: How to Deny Science, Sell Lies, and Make a Killing in the Corporate World. Unabridged. New York: Random House Audio.

                    > Are you a corporation out to make your fortune at any cost? Are you worried about “facts” and “experts” getting in the way of your profits? Do you wish you could make scientists, journalists, and anyone who asks questions about your suspect business practices disappear? Now you can.
                    >
                    > Whether you are selling tobacco, dealing in oil, or pushing pharmaceuticals, denying climate change or exploiting workers, The Playbook is here to help you obfuscate your way to what you want.

                    > Including how to:
                    >
                    > Massage the statistics to suit your needs. Or, even better, fund studies to make up some new ones
                    > Attract and cultivate university professors who have an axe to grind and are short of cash

                    ## Progress in International Treaties

                    - The Kyoto Protocol: adopted on December 11th, 1997, in force on February 16th, 2005
                        - 1st commitment period 2008 to 2012 - 5% reduction against 1990 level
                        - 2nd commitment period 2013 to 2020 - 18% reduction against 1990 level
                        - Mixed results
                    - The Paris Agreement aims to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature
                        - Goal of increase in this century to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels
                        - The agreement: commitments from all major emitting countries
                        - Countries agreed cut their climate-altering pollution and to strengthen those commitments over time
                        - 197 countries—every nation on earth, with the last signatory being war-torn Syria—have adopted the Paris Agreement, Of those, 179 have solidified their climate proposals with formal approval, including the U.S.
                        - US left in 2020 and rejoined in 2021

                    ## Some other Potential Solutions

                    - More International Agreements and Treaties
                    - Changing the payoffs facing individuals and firms
                        - Forcing firms to pay their share of cost of these externalities that they produce
                        - Governmental incentives to encourage public and private consumptions (e.g. public transportation and private cars)
                        - Carbon pricing (cap-and-trade, carbon tax)
                    - Common Pool Resource management and regulation
                    - Non-profit organizations in place of for-profit corporations

                    ## Free-Rider Problem Vaccine Refusal Discussion

                    - Recent Measles Outbreaks (Florida most recently)
                        - Measles has an R0 of ~15 meaning that "every person infected with measles will go on to sicken 15 additional people. [(ABC News)](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/r0-covid-19-virus-key-metric-opening-plans/story?id=70868997)
                        - Declared eliminated in the US in 2000 [(CDC)](https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/s0424-highest-measles-cases-since-elimination.html)
                        - Measles not only kills, but also causes brain damage and [impairs the immune system's memory](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay6485)
                    - Reich, Jennifer A. 2014. "Neoliberal Mothering and Vaccine Refusal: Imagined Gated Communities and the Privilege of Choice." Gender & Society 28(5):679-704.
                        - Mothers see themselves as experts on their children, they deem the risk of infection as less than those of vaccines (they dismiss claims that vaccines are necessary)
                        - Mothers see their intensive practices (controlling feeding, nutrition etc.) as a "superior means of supporting their children's immunity."
                        >"they attempt to control risk through management of social exposure, as they envision disease risk to lie in "foreign" bodies outside their networks, and, therefore, individually manageable."
                        >
                        >"these mothers focus solely on their own children by evaluating—and often rejecting—assertions that their choices undermine community health, while ignoring how their children benefit from the immunity of others."
