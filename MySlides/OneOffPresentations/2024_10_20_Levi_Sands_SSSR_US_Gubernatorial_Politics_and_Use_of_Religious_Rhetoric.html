                    <!-- Abstract -->
                    <!-- In the US, politicians often use religious terminology in speeches given. These speeches contain a wealth of information about the politicians, their voters, and other social dynamics. Prior research has pointed to the importance of signaling the social identities of the candidate to the voters. In this study, I use over 30,000 political speeches collected by Vote Smart to examine how different candidates use or do not use religious terminology in their speeches. Using a combination of regressions and content analyses, I analyze several demographic factors and discussion of various topics to determine who is using religious terminology and in what contexts. The interaction of party and gender shows that republican women are using religious terms far more than any other group of politicians in the sample. -->

                        ## Religious Political Rhetoric

                        - Religious rhetoric has a long history in US Politics (Chapp 2012; Perry 2023)
                        - Religious rhetoric has been increasing in recent years (Hughes 2019; Perry 2023)
                        - Two main types of religious political rhetoric (Chapp 2012)
                            - Civil religion rhetoric - meant to unite
                                - Civil religion identity
                            - Culture wars rhetoric - meant to divide
                                - Convey moral crisis
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Research Questions

                        - Is there is a similar increase in religious rhetoric among US Gubernatorial candidates as seen with Presidential Candidates (Hughes 2019; Perry 2023)?
                        - Does the proportion of culture wars rhetoric as opposed to civil religion rhetoric differ significantly over time (Chapp)?
                        - Does the proportion of culture wars rhetoric as opposed to civil religion rhetoric differ significantly by party?
                        - Does the proportion of culture wars rhetoric as opposed to civil religion rhetoric differ significantly by gender?
                        - Does the proportion of culture wars rhetoric as opposed to civil religion rhetoric differ significantly by religious affiliation?
                        - Does the proportion of culture wars rhetoric as opposed to civil religion rhetoric differ significantly with the religiosity of the state?

                        ## Main Goals

                        - Use unsupervised topic modeling as the main tool for analysis (Grootendorst 2022; Maerz and Schneider 2020)
                            - See how far I can get toward answering these research questions with just topic modeling
                            - Construct more comprehensive dictionaries
                        - Become more familiar with the data
                        - Determine next steps
                    </section>

                        ## Topic Modeling

                        - Unsupervised vs supervised
                        - Topic Modeling As a Method of Analysis
                            - Several steps to get topic model outputs, each of those steps have tradeoffs: embedding, dimensionality reduction, clustering, tokenization, weighting scheme, and sometimes more (Grootendorst 2022)
                            - Newer pre-trained embedding models use context to keep more semantic information (Devlin et al. 2019)
                            - "'[T]opics' (clusters of words associated with a single theme) emerge inductively based on patterns of co-occurrence of words in a corpus." (Supran and Oreskes 2021 p 713)

                        ## Data

                        - Project Vote Smart's (PVS) database of political speeches
                        - Included all gubernatorial candidates for all elections from 2003 through March of 2023
                        - Data is from 10 states selected to represent a diversity of states in size, political control and regions of the country
                            - AL, AZ, CA, ID, IL, ND, NY, RI, TX, WA
                        - I used the Press Release, Speech, and Statement categories for a total of 34,192 "speeches"
                        - A total of 77 politicians
                        - For the purposes of analysis I split the data into sentences using pysbd (Sadvilkar and Neumann 2020)
                            - Resulted in 855,440 total sentences

                        ## Religious/Christian Dictionary Terms

                        - I used religious terms then using regular expressions filtered to get just those sentences that contained one of the target religious terms
                            - The terms I included were derived from Chapp (2012) and inclusions of my own
                            - All included terms have a minimum of 50 occurrences (lowest number was 74)
                            - I selected a random sample of each term to determine if at least each term had >85% religious usage of the term
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Religious/Christian Dictionary Terms

                        - In (mostly) plain English the terms included used are below:
                            - bibl, christ, christian, christianity, christians, christmas, christmases, church, churches, faith, god, holy, jesus, lord, pray, religio, sacred, worship
                        - I used various methods to account for different forms of the terms
                            - Example: to match with all forms of term, I used a word stem ("bibl")
                            - Example: explicity used different forms of a term ("christ", "christian", "christianity")
                        - In regex format: `bibl|faith|pray|religio|sacred|worship|(\b|\W|\s)(church|churches)(\b|\W|\s)|(\b|\W|\s)christ(ian|ianity|ians|mas|mases|\b|\W|\s)(\b|\W|\s)|(\b|\W|\s)god(\b|\W|\s)|(\b|\W|\s)holy(\b|\W|\s)|(\b|\W|\s)jesus(\b|\W|\s)|(\b|\W|\s)lord(\b|\W|\s)`

                        - A surprising amount of the candidates gave no religion that I could find (~15%)

                        - Used BERTopic with hierarchical clustering (HDBSCAN) in an unsupervised topic model (Grootendorst 2022)
                            - 55 total topics
                            - Example: see topic 30 caught the term "spray"

                        > Topic 40: "Let us continue to pray for our fallen firefighters and their families" (Brewer R AZ 2014)
                        >
                        > Topic 40: "Now, we're also praying for Officer James Veentra, who has been wounded in the same incident." (Schwarzenegger R CA 2008)
                        >

                        ## Topic Modeling

                        - The topic modeling sometimes picked up on nuances that I will almost certainly use in the future
                            - In topic 40 topic the prayers were being offered as a way to help or acknowledge other's suffering
                            - In Topic 39 the use of prayer is instead about what prayer does or does not do
                        - In other cases I can only guess as why some passages were grouped (NY and AL)

                        ## Topic Modeling

                        - Another comparitive example
                        > Topic 4: "May God Bless You and the Great State of Alabama." (Riley R AL 2003)
                        >
                        > Topic 4: "I believe in Alabama, a state dedicated to a faith in God and the enlightenment of mankind" (Ivey R AL 2018)
                        >
                        > Topic 4: "Marriage Equality is a matter of fairness and legal security for thousands of families in this state -- not of religion or culture." (Cuomo D NY 2011)
                        >
                        > Topic 4: "The new law shields persons from civil and criminal liability in New York courts if they act in good faith" (Spitzer D NY 2007)

                        ## Future Research

                        - Get more speech data
                        - Update the dictionary
                            - Espcially to include more non-christian religious terms
                        - Create some negitive filtering
                            - For example remove sentences good faith
                        - Replace terms that confound the model with a generic term
                            - Replace all state names with STATENAME
                        - Run the topic model again
                        - Qualitatively code the data
                        - Quantitativly run regressions
