                    ## Theoretical Background

                    - Markets
                        - Change in markets and as the focal point for contentious social interactions (Fligstein and Dauter 2007; Haedicke 2016; King and Pearce 2010)
                        - Sociocognitive categories as common understandings within a market (Khaire and Wadhwani 2010)
                            - For example what should be considered "meat"
                        - The establishment of legitimacy of new products and organization practices or goals (Lee, Hiatt, and Lounsbury 2017; Vasi 2007)
                    - Field Theory (also called a Theory of Fields)
                        - Based on Fligstein and McAdam (2011; 2012)
                            - Strategic Action Fields (SAF) in this case the meat market
                            - Incumbents who try to maintain dominant position in SAF
                            - Challengers who try to "break into" the market
                            - Governance Units who manage field rules
                    - Contribution to literature
                        - Adding Incumbent and Challenger "Aligned" organizations
                            - Describing differences from incumbents and their "uses"
                        - Adding example of challenger response to incumbent actions

                    ## Data

                    - 22,686 press releases, advertisements, blog posts etc.
                        - 15 organizations
                        - Includes YouTube video subtitles
                    - Will likely update data to include more through the end of 2024
                        - I have updated many of these sources through 2024
                        - Still have a few organizations that need to be collected
                        - Updated data not yet included in database

                    ## Content Analyses

                    - I have gathered quotes relevant to the change in strategies to highlight quantitative findings
                    - Examples from draft of dissertation
                        - In one example the CCF released a YouTube video during the Super Bowl in 2020. In this ad the CCF depicts a spelling bee where the child is required to spell out methylcellulose when is then describes as a
                        > "laxative that is also used in synthetic meat [...] You might need a PhD to understand what's in synthetic meat" (Center for Consumer Freedom 2020)
                        - Less than one week later, Impossible founder and CEO Patrick Brown appears in an ad on YouTube also depicting a spelling bee where the child is required to spell out "poop" and later he says, 
                        > "there's poop in the ground beef we make from cows" (Impossible Foods 2020).
                        - Other incumbent aligned organizations like the NCBA and the USCA, which are both cattlemen's associations called for intervention by the governance unit (the USDA) to require labeling regulations on challenger products. In the quote below from a press-release from the NCBA describing their support for meat labeling rules and regulations.
                        > "Woodall focused on the need for the federal government to ensure that beef nomenclature is protected in the marketing and labeling of fake meat. He also said the organization will continue to educate consumers about what exactly is in the plant-based fake meat that is available in supermarkets and restaurants." NCBA - 2019-07
                    - Partially complete but as I'm writing the chapters I'll likely gather or change quotes already selected

                    ## Structure of Dissertation

                    - Chapter 1
                        - Introduction: covers theory, pre-disruption background information and data description
                    - Chapter 2
                        - Findings for the disruption stage
                    - Chapter 3
                        - Findings for the containment stage
                    - Chapter 4
                        - Findings for the realignment stage
                    - Chapter 5

                    ## Directions for Future Research

                    - Add media outlets coverage of the topics
                        - Use process tracing to analyze media coverage of plant-based meat products and organizations
                        - Had started on this (gathered some media data) but do not have the time or resources at the moment

                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Tasks to Complete Before Dissertation Defense

                    - Finish Hypothesis development
                    - Complete separation of graphs into the phases to match chapter structure
                    - Non-required tasks to complete
                        - Update the database to include all (or most) organizations through the end of 2024

                    ## Preliminary Findings (TODO: find a new home for this maybe)

                    - During Disruption phase
                        - Challengers use rhetoric to justify their place in the meat market
                        - Challengers also seek to differentiate themselves from incumbents based on climate/environmental reasoning
                        - Challengers aligned organizations largely mirror challenger rhetoric once established
                        - No immediate response from incumbents to challengers
                    - During Containment phase
                        - Incumbents "use" some aligned orgs to "stay clean" of attacks
                            - CCF is (likely) paid by incumbent organizations to "attack" challengers
                        - Some aligned organizations are not always in lock step due to differing goals
                            - Some of the Beef Associations are also contributing to the "attack" on challengers but in different ways from CCF (e.g. appealing to Governance Units)
                        - Incumbents setup competing products to challengers
                    - During the Realignment phase
                        - Challengers take different approaches to successful "attacks" on their products
                        - Challengers aligned organizations largely mirror challenger rhetoric
