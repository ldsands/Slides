                        Despite our data mostly consisting of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints we will use the terms Mormon/Mormonism as they are common in the academic literature and as a way to acknowledge the broader Latter-day Saint movement

                        ## Mormon Theology

                        - Latter-day Saints don't have a systematic theology (Blythe 2020)
                        - Mythology and narrative theology inherited from Joseph Smith (Flake 2007)
                        - Personal revelation and doctrine as taught by church leaders can come in conflict (Knoll and Riess 2020)
                        - These characteristics of Mormon theology leaves many areas of differing beliefs, speculations and areas for discussion

<!-- [BEGIN ABSTRACT]

Although top Latter-day Saint leaders lay exclusive claim to define official doctrine, their theology has rarely (if ever) been systematically organized or updated. Thus, contemporary Mormon theology is the product of the accretion of theological speculation, doctrinal evolution, identity development, and policy refinement over the course of two centuries. Despite the top-down ecclesiastical structure of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, this process of accretion (rather than systematization) creates considerable opportunities for "everyday" Latter-day Saints to engage in theological speculation.

For our proposed presentation, we will present results of our analysis of theological discussion and speculation on the LDS Freedom Forum. As the name indicates, this online discussion forum presents itself as a gathering place for Mormon conservatives and libertarians. However, it is also an active site for discussions about Mormonism and Mormon theology. These discussions include speculation about theological questions no longer emphasized by contemporary Church leaders (e.g, the identities of God and Adam) and criticism of contemporary Church leaders' perceived liberalism.

We collected the posts from the LDS Freedom Forum from its inception in 2005 through December 2021. Our analysis will be based on two stages. The first stage involves hierarchical topic modeling, which computationally sorts 800,000 forum posts into 600 thematic "topics." The second stage uses qualitative grounded theory to examine theologically-salient topics and identify both high and low-level content categories. We will present our findings of how participants reconcile and rationalize theological concepts with personal beliefs and experiences through discourse with other participants.

                        - Collected all posts made to the LDS Freedom Forum
                            - From the inception in 2005 through December 2021
                            - Over 800,000 posts

                        ## Methods - Topic Modeling

                        - Topic Modeling As a Method of Analysis
                            - Several steps to get topic model outputs, each of those steps have tradeoffs: embedding, dimensionality reduction, clustering, tokenization, weighting scheme, and sometimes more (Grootendorst 2022)
                            - Newer pre-trained embedding models use context to keep more semantic information (Devlin et al. 2019)
                            - "'[T]opics' (clusters of words associated with a single theme) emerge inductively based on patterns of co-occurrence of words in a corpus." (Supran and Oreskes 2021 p 713)

                        ## Methods - Qualitatively Selecting Theological Topics

                        - Qualitative selection of topics
                            - Based on the top key words/phrases that touched on theological topics
                            - Preference for topics not explicity political
                        - Resulted in 103 topics that focus on theological topics
                        - Identified 5 candidate topics
                        - Confirmed theological nature of posts for small number of select topics
                        - Selected 3 threads for each topic from list of threads with the highest number of posts assigned the target topic
                        
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Methods - Qualitative Coding

                        - The 3 threads for the first topic (polygamy) produced code saturation
                        - Reviewed 3 threads (602 posts) to become familiar with data
                        - Developed proto-codes based on notes from review
                            - "Theological Ontology"
                            - "Theological Epistemology"
                        - Next steps:
                            - Develop formal codebook
                            - Formal analysis of posts
